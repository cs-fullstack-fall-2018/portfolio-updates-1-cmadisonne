# portfolio-updates-1

1) Where are you now? 

My portfolio is in good standing. The color schemes and picture need to be changed. And my home page needs to be rethought out. 

2) What are you going to finish today?

I am going to finish all of the functionality things like linking to a certain part of the page.

3) What will you finish by the end of the week?

I will definitely try to finish everything by the end of the week. Most importantly, I want to get my projects up and pushed out so that I can include on my project page.
